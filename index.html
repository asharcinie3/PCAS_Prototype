                <h3>About</h3>
                <p>This site introduces 10 different scenarios that are demonstrated in the PCAS prototype. These scenarios were given
                     to us by the customer and are detailed in the separate cases, to the right, including a description and demonstration
                      of each scenario and how the PCAS system will react to the scenario. All of the scenarios have some consistencies 
                      with both the autonomous vehicle and the pedestrian.</p>
                <h3>Constants</h3>
                <img src="about.png" alt="picture to model consistencies">
                <p>The autonomous vehicle in all scenarios will have an initial steady state velocity that 
                    is controllable with the brake by wire system. It will always be heading straight along the +x axis. It will always 
                    start at the origin(0,0). The pedestrian will always have a static or constant speed in a direction parallel to the 
                    y axis. Their initial position will always be (35,7).</p>
