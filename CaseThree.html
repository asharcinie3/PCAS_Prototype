                <h3>Static: Scenario 8</h3>
                <p>In this scenario, the Pedestrian will start at the position of (35,0) and will not move for the duration 
                    of the scenario. This will leave the pedestrian in the path of the autonomous vehicle for the whole scenario. 
                    The PCAS will respond by communicating with the brake by wire system to decelerate the vehicle to 16 km/h (4.44m/s)
                    while the pedestrian is within 4.5 meters from the vehicle. It will then decelerate more and come to a complete stop,
                    1.5 meters from where the pedestrian is, for the duration of the demonstration. </p>

                <h3>Static: Scenario 9</h3>
                <p>In this scenario, the Pedestrian will start at the position of (35,-2) and will not move for the duration of the
                    scenario. This will leave the pedestrian in the collision zone for the whole scenario. The PCAS will respond by
                    communicating with the brake by wire system to decelerate the vehicle to 16 km/h (4.44m/s) while the pedestrian 
                    is within 4.5 meters from the vehicle. It will then decelerate more and come to a complete stop, 1.5 meters from where
                    the pedestrian is, for the duration of the demonstration. </p>

                <h3>Static: Scenario 10</h3>
                <p>In this scenario, the Pedestrian will start at the position of (35,-4) and will not move for the duration of the
                    scenario. For this scenario the pedestrian will never be in the path of the autonomous vehicle and will not be
                    moving so the PCAS does not need to communicate with the brake by wire system and the autonomous vehicle will
                    continue with its initial velocity. </p>
