                    of 10 kilometers per hour(13.89m/s). They will begin at (35,-7) and continue until they come to a stop 
                    at (35,0) giving them a final speed of 0 kilometers per hour. This leaves the pedestrian stopped
                    directly in the path of the autonomous vehicle with a potential time of impact at 2.5 seconds. In this scenario

                    to decelerate the autonomous vehicle stopping the vehicle 1.5 meters before it collides with the pedestrian.
