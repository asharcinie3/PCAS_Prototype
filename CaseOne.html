                <p>In this scenario, the pedestrian will be moving in the positive y direction with an initial speed
                    of 10 km/h (13.89m/s). They will begin at (35,-7) and continue until they come to a stop 
                    at (35,0) giving them a final speed of 0 km/h. This leaves the pedestrian stopped
                    directly in the path of the autonomous vehicle with a potential time of impact of 2.16 seconds. In this scenario, 
                    the PCAS will input the data from the stereo camera and communicate with the brake by wire system
                    to decelerate the autonomous vehicle stopping the vehicle 1.5 meters before it collides with the pedestrian.

                <p>In this scenario, the pedestrian will be moving in the positive y direction with an initial speed of 10 km/h (13.89m/s). 
                    They will begin at (35,-7) and continue until they come to a stop at (35,-2) giving them a final speed
                    of 0 km/h. This leaves the pedestrian outside of the collision zone. This is because the width of the 
                    autonomous vehicle is 2.0 meters wide. In this scenario, the PCAS will input the data from the stereo camera and determine
                    initially that it needs to slow down, as the system will not exceed 16km/h (4.4m/s) if a pedestrian is within 4.5 meters away.
                    Once the stereo camera detects that the pedestrian has stopped outside of the collision zone and that the pedestrian
                    is over 4.5m away, it will accelerate at a steady rate of 0.25g, accelerating at 2.45m/s, until it reaches a steady state velocity.
